# SemantiFin

## A Contextual Financial Insight Extraction Framework Using Large Language Models, Temporal Narrative Aggregation, and Credibility-Aware Fusion

SemantiFin is a modular Python research framework for converting heterogeneous financial text into structured, evidence-grounded, temporally aware, credibility-sensitive financial intelligence representations. The framework combines LLM-based event extraction, temporal narrative aggregation, credibility-aware multi-source fusion, and structured representation learning to support downstream financial analytics.

> **Scope:** The current implementation is entirely classical. It generates quantum-compatible representations for future research but does not perform quantum computation or claim quantum advantage.

# Features

- Schema-guided financial event and claim extraction
- Entity, polarity, impact, temporal horizon and risk extraction
- Evidence-grounded financial intelligence
- Narrative drift analysis
- Credibility-aware multi-source fusion
- Structured 256-dimensional representation learning
- PCA reduction to 128 dimensions
- Deterministic offline mode
- Optional OpenAI backend
- YAML-based configuration
- Reproducible research pipeline
